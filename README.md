This is a [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) template for removing
the boilerplate in setting up a new scala project:

* `main` and `test` source directories and stubs
* SBT simple confguration for `0.11.0`, scala `2.9.1`, and `scalatest + JUnit` dependencies
* project `name`, `organization` and `version` customizable as variables
* everything in your project's base package imported automatically in repl sessions
